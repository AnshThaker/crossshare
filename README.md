# CrossShare v1.0
CrossShare is a seamless and cross-platform file sharing application that allows users to easily transfer files between devices on a local network.
<br>
<br>
If CrossShare has the necessary network and storage permissions (these can be tweaked in the settings app), files will be transferred swiftly and be saved in the 'Downloads' folder (Windows and macOS) or the 'Documents' folder in your internal storage (Android). If a 'Documents' folder does not exist, please create one in your Android internal storage.
